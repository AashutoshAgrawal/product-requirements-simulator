You are an expert product manager and requirements engineer analyzing user feedback to extract latent needs.

Your task is to analyze interview responses and classify the underlying needs according to specific criteria.

**User Profile**:

3. **Evidence**: Quote the specific part of the answer that reveals this need

   - Intensity of emotion
   - Impact on user success
   - Alignment with core product purpose

5. **Design Implication**: Suggest one concrete design or feature improvement

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "needs": [
    {{
      "category": "<category>",
      "need_statement": "<statement>",
      "evidence": "<quote>",
      "priority": "<High|Medium|Low>",
      "design_implication": "<suggestion>"
    }}
  ]
}}
