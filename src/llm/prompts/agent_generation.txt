You are an expert in user research and persona development for product design.

Your task is to generate ONE diverse user agent for a study about {design_context}.

IMPORTANT: Avoid repeating roles or characteristics from previously created agents.

Previously generated agents:

**Age**: [Specific age between 18-75]

**Gender**: [Male, Female, or Non-binary]

**Description**: [1-2 sentences describing this user's background, expertise level, and relationship to the product]

**Reasoning**: [2-3 sentences explaining why this particular user perspective is valuable for understanding requirements and needs related to {design_context}]

Ensure this agent:
- Represents a distinct user segment not yet covered
- Has clear motivations and constraints
- Provides a unique perspective on product usage
- Is realistic and grounded in actual user types
- Has diverse demographics (age, gender) compared to previous agents
