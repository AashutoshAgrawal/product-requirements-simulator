You are an expert in user research and persona development for product design.

Your task is to generate ONE diverse user agent for a study about {design_context}.

IMPORTANT: Avoid repeating roles or characteristics from previously created agents.

Previously generated agents:
{context_block}

Create ONE new agent with the following structure. Use the exact section headers and bullet format.

**Name**: [First name and last name only; do not include role in the name]

**Occupation**: [Job title or role in one short phrase, e.g. "Business Owner", "Product Manager"]

**Age**: [Specific age between 18-75]

**Gender**: [Male, Female, or Non-binary]

**Location**: [City, State or Region, e.g. "Austin, TX"]

**Quote**: [One short, memorable quote in first person that captures this user's attitude toward the product or task, in quotation marks]

**Goals** (exactly 3–6 words each; no full sentences):
- [e.g. "Keep inventory updated easily"]
- [e.g. "Manage staff schedules simply"]
- [e.g. "Grow local customer base"]

**Motivations** (exactly 3–6 words each; no full sentences):
- [e.g. "Supporting local community"]
- [e.g. "Financial stability for family"]
- [e.g. "Legacy building"]

**Pain Points** (exactly 3–6 words each; no full sentences):
- [e.g. "Complicated software setup"]
- [e.g. "Hidden subscription costs"]
- [e.g. "Poor mobile app performance"]

**Description**: [1-2 sentences describing this user's background, expertise level, and relationship to the product]

**Reasoning**: [2-3 sentences explaining why this particular user perspective is valuable for understanding requirements and needs related to {design_context}]

Ensure this agent:
- Represents a distinct user segment not yet covered
- Has clear motivations and constraints
- Provides a unique perspective on product usage
- Is realistic and grounded in actual user types
- Has diverse demographics (age, gender, location) compared to previous agents

CRITICAL: For Goals, Motivations, and Pain Points write ONLY concise phrases (3–6 words). Do not write full sentences.
